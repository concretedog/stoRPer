[Check out the youtube video](https://youtu.be/Y8ddx1Og3Xw?feature=shared) with details about the design and the design thinking, at the moment it's probably the best documentation! 



Basic Bill Of Materials, This is just a guide for a basic build as you could build up the PCB in any way you can imagine!

The PCB, Available on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/concreted0g/storper/)
4* N20 metal gear motors in a gear ratio of your choice rated up to 6V. <br />
4* 3D printed motor mount clips to attach the motors (files in the 3D models section or periodically available on the tindie listing as an options)<br />
8* 6mm M2 bolts and nuts to attach motor mounts.<br />
A raspberry pi Pico or Pico W, or equivalent footprint microcontroller board.<br />
Some N20 compatible wheels (either commercial or home brew/3D printed)<br />
Some kind of power supply (simplest is a small USB pack, other options are a 14500 or 18650 cell wired into the power input)<br />
Semi optional, an upper deck to attach power supply too. (Inkscape files for Lasercutting or CNC or heck, cutting out with a saw, are in the Deck Drawing folder, or available lasercut on the Tindie listing)<br />

But that's just a guide, you could use different items or design to the basic PCB/chassis in different ways. <br />

All the KiCad files in the repo were originally made in version 7.xx. 

**Update 28-05-2024**

Added an Addons folder which currently contains 2 new PCB designs. <br />

Bumper can receive an ultrasonic module (HC-SR04) and also have 2 bump switches connected. <br />
The Kludge Deck conforms to the StoRPer main PCB layout with lots of prototyping space and extra holes for mounting stuff!

KiCad design originally made in version 7.xx <br />
In the main project the motor drivers are placed in hierarchical sheets. This is as I was writing a tutorial on Hierarchical sheets at the time!<br />
In the schmatics.pdf the Motor driver sections are all in the main sheet for easier reading. <br />
